# When to use
 Letâ€™s assume that you are creating a User form, which contains fields like EntryPlace,EntryTime,TotalTimeOut,ExitTime and you want the user to enter valid time. Here depending upon the requirement these scenarios may arise.	
1. Adding Custom Message on password Field.
2. Apply validation in Password validation there is validators on digit, alphabets, contains, lowerCase, upperCase, specialCharacter, minLength, maxLength.
3. Apply dynamic validation, If the validation will be changed based on some criteria in the application.

# Basic password Validation
First we need to create LoginInfo model class define a property of password in the model to achieve the functional need of point 1.
[!code-typescript[](../../examples/reactive-form-validators/password/rxweb-password-validation-add-angular-reactive-form/src/app/login-info/login-info.model.ts?highlight=5)]

Now, we need to create a FormGroup in the component. To achieve this we need to add RxFormBuilder. The RxFormBuilder is an injectable service that is provided with the RxReactiveFormsModule. Inject this dependency by adding it to the component constructor.
Here we have covered Add and Edit form operations.
